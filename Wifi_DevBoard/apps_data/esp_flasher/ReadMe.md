# ESP32 Flasher (from Flipper)

You can flash from the Flipper without a computer at all thanks to [Cococode's (aka 0xchocolate) utility](https://github.com/0xchocolate/flipperzero-esp-flasher).<br>
The above are the files you'll need, plus here's a [vid walkthrough](https://youtu.be/Kme-yWL14N8) (both thanks to TalkingSasquach!)

[Download all the files above](https://uberguidoz.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/tree/main/Wifi_DevBoard/apps_data/esp_flasher) in a ZIP using DownGit.
